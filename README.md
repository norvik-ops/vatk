## What is Vakt?

Vakt is a self-hosted, source-available security and compliance platform built for SMEs in the DACH region. It helps IT teams implement and document NIS2, ISO 27001, BSI-Grundschutz, DORA, TISAX, and EU AI Act requirements — without sending any data outside your own infrastructure.

It is a free-to-self-host alternative to commercial tools like Vanta or Drata (~€10,000/year), licensed under the Elastic License 2.0. Deploy it with a single `docker compose up` command — the platform is **ready in under 5 minutes**. The bundled local AI advisor takes a bit longer on first start because it downloads the ~1.9 GB `qwen2.5:3b` model — depending on your bandwidth, expect an extra **3–30 minutes** until AI features are available. The platform itself works without waiting for the model.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/norvik-ops/vatk
cd vatk
cp .env.example .env

# Generate a secure secret key (required):
sed -i 's/VAKT_SECRET_KEY=.*/VAKT_SECRET_KEY='"$(openssl rand -hex 32)"'/' .env

docker compose up -d
```

Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) in your browser.

> When `VAKT_DEMO=true` is set, the login screen automatically shows a set of fresh, ephemeral credentials. These credentials are randomly generated per session and expire after 4 hours — there are no static demo passwords.

> **Migrations** run automatically on every `docker compose up -d` — a dedicated `migrate` container applies all pending migrations before the API and worker start.

## System Requirements

| | Minimum | Recommended | With AI Advisor (default) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CPU** | 2 vCPU | 4 vCPU | 4 vCPU — no GPU needed |
| **RAM** | 2 GB | 4 GB | 4 GB (+2 GB for model) |
| **Disk** | 20 GB SSD | 40 GB SSD | 40 GB SSD (+3 GB for model) |
| **Docker Engine** | 24+ | 24+ | 24+ |

The AI advisor runs locally via Ollama on CPU — no GPU, no cloud API key required, and **Community since v0.6.x** (no Pro license needed). Ollama starts automatically with `docker compose up`; an `ollama-init` container pulls the default model (`qwen2.5:3b`, Apache 2.0, ~1.9 GB RAM) on first launch — no manual `ollama pull` step. Other options: `llama3.2:1b` (smaller), `phi3.5:mini` (Microsoft, MIT), or Mistral EU API. To disable on small VMs: set `VAKT_AI_PROVIDER=disabled` and remove the `ollama`/`ollama-init` services via compose-override.

---

## AI Compliance Advisor

Vakt includes a built-in AI advisor that analyses your organisation's real compliance gaps and answers "What should I do this week?" — specific to your data, running entirely on your server.

**Enabled by default** via a local Ollama container (CPU-only, no GPU, no API key, no Pro license). Default model is `qwen2.5:3b` (Apache 2.0, ~1.9 GB RAM, good German performance). The model is pulled automatically by the `ollama-init` container on first `docker compose up` — no manual step.

To switch to a different model:

```bash
docker compose exec ollama ollama pull phi3.5:mini
echo 'VAKT_AI_MODEL=phi3.5:mini' >> .env
docker compose restart api worker
```

**Model alternatives** (all CPU-only, choose based on your RAM budget):

| Model | RAM | License | Note |
|-------|-----|---------|------|
| `qwen2.5:3b` | 1.9 GB | Apache 2.0 | Default — fast, good DE |
| `llama3.2:1b` | 1.3 GB | Llama Comm. | Most economical |
| `llama3.2:3b` | 2.0 GB | Llama Comm. | Meta, balanced |
| `phi3.5:mini` | 2.3 GB | MIT | Microsoft, structured outputs |
| `gemma2:2b` | 1.6 GB | Gemma Terms | Google, more restrictive license |

To use a cloud provider instead (e.g. Mistral AI EU, OpenAI):

```env
VAKT_AI_BASE_URL=https://api.mistral.ai/v1
VAKT_AI_API_KEY=sk-...
VAKT_AI_MODEL=mistral-small-latest
```

To disable entirely: `VAKT_AI_PROVIDER=disabled`
