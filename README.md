## What is Vakt?

Vakt is a self-hosted, source-available security and compliance platform built for SMEs in the DACH region. It helps IT teams implement and document NIS2, ISO 27001, and BSI-Grundschutz requirements — without sending any data outside your own infrastructure.

It is a free-to-self-host alternative to commercial tools like Vanta or Drata (~€10,000/year), licensed under the Elastic License 2.0. Deploy it with a single `docker compose up` command — under 5 minutes on a typical server connection, under 3 minutes with cached images.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/norvik-ops/vatk
cd vatk
cp .env.example .env

# Generate a secure secret key (required):
sed -i 's/VAKT_SECRET_KEY=.*/VAKT_SECRET_KEY='"$(openssl rand -hex 32)"'/' .env

docker compose up -d
```

Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) in your browser.

Demo login (requires `VAKT_DEMO=true`): `admin@vakt.local` / `admin1234`

> **Migrations** run automatically on every `docker compose up -d` — a dedicated `migrate` container applies all pending migrations before the API and worker start.

## AI Compliance Advisor

Vakt includes a built-in AI advisor that analyses your organisation's real compliance gaps and answers "What should I do this week?" — specific to your data, running entirely on your server.

**Enabled by default** via a local Ollama container (CPU-only, no GPU, no API key). Pull the model once after first start:

```bash
docker compose --profile ai exec ollama ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```

To use a cloud provider instead (e.g. Mistral AI, OpenAI):

```env
VAKT_AI_BASE_URL=https://api.mistral.ai/v1
VAKT_AI_API_KEY=sk-...
VAKT_AI_MODEL=mistral-small-latest
```

To disable entirely: `VAKT_AI_PROVIDER=disabled`
