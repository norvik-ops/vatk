### Added
- **DSGVO Art. 32 TOM-Mapping** — New framework "DSGVO-TOM" with 13 technical and organisational measures (TOM-1 through TOM-13) mapped automatically to existing ISO 27001 controls. Coverage dashboard shows which TOMs are fully covered, partially covered, or open.

## [v0.4.0] — 2026-05-14

### Added
- **DORA support** — Digital Operational Resilience Act (EU 2022/2554) is now a selectable framework in Vakt Comply. Includes all relevant DORA articles as controls (German), DORA ↔ ISO 27001 mapping, gap analysis, readiness score, and PDF export.
- **DORA IKT Incident Register** — New incident type "IKT-Vorfall (DORA)" with automatic deadline calculation (T+4h / T+24h / T+72h / T+30d) and traffic-light status per deadline. Webhook notifications on deadline breach.
- **DORA IKT Third-Party Register** — Supplier records extended with DORA criticality, subcontractors, data processing location (EU/non-EU), and exit strategy fields.
- **DORA Resilience Tests** — New section in Vakt Comply for TLPT documentation (DORA Art. 24–27): test type, status, execution date, results, and recommendations.
- **TISAX support** — VDA ISA question catalogue as a selectable framework with protection-level selection (Normal / High / Very high). Maturity scale 0–3 per control. Chapter 15 (prototype protection) shown only when relevant.
- **TISAX ↔ ISO 27001 Mapping** — Static mapping with coverage badges. "Gaps only" toggle filters already-covered controls. Readiness score accounts for ISO 27001 evidence as TISAX coverage.
- **TISAX Readiness Report** — PDF export with protection-level category, readiness score per chapter, maturity distribution, and gap list.
- **Supply Chain Compliance — Supplier Portal** — External, token-based supplier portal at `/supplier/:token` (no login required). Compliance managers send time-limited invitation links; suppliers complete questionnaires and upload certificates (ISO 27001, TISAX labels, etc.) directly in the portal.
- **Questionnaire Builder** — Build supplier assessment questionnaires with question types: Yes/No, Multiple Choice, Free Text, File Upload. Predefined templates: "NIS2 Supplier Assessment", "DORA IKT Third Party", "ISO 27001 Basic Check".
- **Supplier Assessment Review** — Incoming questionnaires reviewable per answer (accepted / requires improvement). Uploaded certificates tracked with expiry date; warning 30 days before expiry. Accepted responses linked automatically as evidence to controls.
- **EU AI Act — AI System Inventory** — New section in Vakt Comply. Register AI systems with provider, use case, affected population groups, decision autonomy, and status. Filter by risk class.
- **EU AI Act — Risk Classification Wizard** — Step-by-step wizard following the EU AI Act Annex III decision tree (prohibition check → high-risk categories → transparency obligations). Result: risk class + justification + relevant articles. Reclassification with change log.
- **EU AI Act — Technical Documentation** — Documentation template per EU AI Act Art. 11 / Annex IV (German). Fields: system description, training data, performance metrics, risk management, human oversight, logging. PDF export and version history.
- **NIS2 / DORA Incident Reporting Assistant** — Reportability classification wizard on incident creation. Automatic authority suggestion based on configured sector. Deadline tracking (T+24h / T+72h / T+30d) with traffic-light status and email notifications 12 hours before each deadline.
- **Incident Report Generator** — One-click report form per deadline (24h / 72h / 30d): pre-filled from incident data, exported as PDF (BSI layout) and JSON. Sent reports archived with timestamp.
- **Authority Directory** — New page in Vakt Comply: list of notification authorities (BSI, BaFin, BNetzA, Luftfahrtbundesamt, BAFZA) with portal URL, phone, and sector-specific notes.
- **Sector Configuration** — Organisation settings now include sector and federal state selection. Responsible authority is suggested automatically in the incident register.
- **Supplier filter improvements** — Criticality filter (critical / essential / standard), assessment status filter, NIS2-relevant and DORA-relevant flags, contract status badges (Active / Expiring / Expired), CSV import and export.

### Fixed
- TypeScript build errors after feature merge (6 type issues resolved).
- Migration 037 (`pg_trgm` indexes) failed in transaction context — added `no-transaction` directive.

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-05-13

### Added
- **PDF report exports** — Vakt Scan generates real PDF reports with findings summary, severity breakdown, and paginated findings table. Vakt Comply frameworks export a readiness PDF (colour-coded score, domain breakdown, gap list). Vakt Aware campaigns export a campaign PDF (click rate, rate bars, Betriebsrat-mode banner).
- **External alerting & webhooks** — Send alerts to Slack, Teams, or any webhook endpoint with HMAC signing (`X-Vakt-Signature`). Configurable per alert type. Exponential backoff on delivery failure (up to 4 retries).
- **Backup & Restore** — `scripts/backup.sh` creates timestamped encrypted archives (PostgreSQL dump + AES-encrypted master key). `scripts/restore.sh` supports `--dry-run` for validation without touching the database. Passphrase must be at least 12 characters.
- **Global Search** — Full-text search across all modules (assets, findings, controls, incidents, policies, suppliers, VVT entries, and more). Powered by `pg_trgm` GIN indexes. Command palette shows "Recently viewed" entries.
- **Score configuration** — Admin UI to adjust weighting of compliance score components. "Reset to defaults" button added.
- **Automatic database migrations** — Dedicated `migrate` container runs all pending migrations before the API and worker start on every `docker compose up -d`.
- **Isolated demo instances** — `POST /demo/start` creates a fresh organisation with unique credentials per visitor. No shared demo state between visitors.

### Fixed
- Alert deduplication: alerts now fire at most once per 24 hours per event type per organisation (no more alert floods on each cron tick).
- `window.open()` exports caused 401 errors because Bearer tokens cannot be sent via URL — all exports switched to `fetch()` + Blob download.
- Nullable `description` field in breach records caused crashes when `NULL` — fixed with `COALESCE`.
