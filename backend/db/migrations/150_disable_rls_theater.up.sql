-- 150_disable_rls_theater.up.sql
--
-- Migration 012 enabled Row Level Security on eight module tables with
-- policies referencing the session variable `app.current_org_id`. The
-- application never set that variable — and because no FORCE was applied,
-- the App-User (as table owner) bypassed RLS entirely anyway. The setup
-- *looked* like defense-in-depth but provided none.
--
-- Three options were considered (see ADR-0042):
--   A) wire `SET LOCAL app.current_org_id` into every pgxpool acquisition
--   B) remove the RLS scaffolding and own the truth (App-layer enforcement)
--   C) keep selective tables under FORCE RLS
--
-- We chose B. The app already enforces org-isolation on every read/write
-- path; the RLS layer added zero protection while suggesting otherwise to
-- auditors and pen-testers. Honest is better than aspirational.
--
-- Should we later want true defense-in-depth, a fresh migration can re-
-- introduce RLS with FORCE and a verified connection-init that sets the
-- session var.  At that point we'll also revisit the 22+ other org-keyed
-- tables that Migration 012 left unprotected (audit_log, ck_risks, hr_*,
-- po_*, sr_* …).
